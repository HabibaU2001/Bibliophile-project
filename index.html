              <strong> Picture this:</strong>
              <br />
              a cosy room filled with the scent of old paper and the rustle of
              pages turning. You're surrounded by shelves bursting with books,
              from the classics to the quirky, the mysterious to the magical.
              This, my friend, is the sanctuary of a bibliophile.

            <h3>What is Bibliophilia?</h3>
            <p>
              Bibliophilia is the fancy term for the passionate love of books.
              It's not just about liking to read; it's about adoring everything
              about booksâ€”their smell, their feel, their stories, and even their
              covers. It's the feeling you get when you walk into a bookstore
              and your heart does a little happy dance.

            <p>
              Hey there! I'm Habiba, your friendly neighbourhood bibliophile
              ðŸ“šâœ¨. If you haven't guessed by now, I'm absolutely obsessed with
              all things books. From the moment I could hold a book, I've been
              diving into magical worlds, solving mysteries, and living a
              thousand lives through the pages.
